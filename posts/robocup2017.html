    <h2>RoboCup 2017.........................July 31</h2>
<p>My RoboCup experience started before I got to Port Messe. I was waiting for a train on the Aonami line to come when I met two team members from Australia, the University of Technology at Sydney. I knew they were going to RoboCup using my expert Holmesian deductive skills. Just kidding, they were both wearing lanyards which said &quot;RoboCup 2017&quot; on them. </p>

<p>I told them I was also going to RoboCup, and we talked for the rest of the ride. Chand and Meg are PhD students in social robotics, which they both believe is going to play a huge role in our futures. After experiencing RoboCup, I have to say that I agree with them. Their team at University of Technology Sydney competes in RoboCup@Home, where teams program robots to interact with humans in a domestic environment (EDIT: Apparently they won 2nd place in this challenge!). The actual robot manufacturer is Softbank; each team receives a robot and must program it to meet specified tasks. Apparently Steve Wozniak (Chand called him Steve Woz…is that an Australian thing?) is on the Sydney team, but unfortunately I didn&#39;t get to meet him. Maybe next year—RoboCup is going to be held in Montreal in 2018. Meg and Chand showed me where the venue was, and then I waited for Katelyn and Trevor to arrive. </p>

<p>Katelyn arrived first. We walked around and encountered many strange robots. There were these cute globular ones with large eyeballs whose sole purpose seemed to be to make conversation. There was another robot which played kendama perfectly. We visited the Amazon Robotics Challenge to watch the CMU team but it was pretty boring. The robotic arm was supposed to be sorting through various objects, but it was incredibly slow at identifying which was which. We watched a bit of robot soccer; Meg had told me that up until last year, the ball had been bright orange instead of black and white, so now it was much more difficult for the robots to track it. The sight of different teams from all around the world and empty pizza boxes reminded me of Science Olympiad, and I found myself wishing that I was a part of such a team at CMU. </p>

<p>During our talk with Chand, Will said he wanted to take a picture with one of the robots. Chand reminded us that we could ask anyone anything about their work or the robots. We shouldn&#39;t be shy. So we went to one of the humanoid soccer fields and talked with two German students from the University of Frankfurt. There was a girl and a guy, both master&#39;s students. The guy explained that since Softbank builds the robots, the real difficulties for each team lie in using its features to their advantage given physical constraints such as power consumption (this is why the team I spoke with chose not to use cameras installed within the robots). The eventual goal of the RoboCup soccer tournaments is that in 2050, a robot soccer team can face a human one in the FIFA World Cup. I asked him which difficulties their team faced, and he began describing how every landmark on the soccer field is doubled, since the field is symmetrical. So, making sure the robots kick into the other team&#39;s goal instead of their own is a difficult challenge. </p>
<p>&quot;How&#39;d you guys overcome that?&quot; I asked. </p>
<p>&quot;With her Bachelor&#39;s thesis actually,&quot; he said, gesturing at the girl, who had gone back to work on the robot. I didn&#39;t understand his explanation completely, but I think the gist is that they record data about the robot&#39;s position on the field so that when it arrives at the goal, based on where it was before, there&#39;s only one option as to which goal it is. Then the robot can decide whether or not to kick. </p>
<p>There were a few other interesting points in our conversation. One is that the team at Frankfurt is entirely student&ndash;run, with PhD students mentoring master&#39;s students. This contrasted with the Australian team&#39;s structure, which has various professors and The Woz as mentors. Also, I learned that the reason why the robots are built by a single company is to even the playing field (literally). This way, universities with substantially more funding won&#39;t always win due to having a more expensive robot. </p>
<p>I also asked what their majors were. They said artificial intelligence, so I started to ask if they knew about the debate between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg. However, the guy cut me off with a dismissive wave. </p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t like that guy,&quot; he said. </p>
<p>I asked why. He said that while Tesla has its merits, he doesn&#39;t see a real need for SpaceX. He considers it &quot;fluff&quot; and not a solid contribution to today&#39;s world. He had a similar line of thought when explaining his views on Musk&#39;s warnings about artificial intelligence. His own research as a master&#39;s student uses artificial intelligence for very practical purposes, such as localization used by the robot in RoboCup soccer. He explained the concept of &quot;singularity&quot; to me, which is the idea of AI systems creating even better AI systems without human input in the future, essentially &quot;breaking evolution.&quot; He thought this was bogus; he gave an anecdote of a guest lecturer dismissing the concept of singularity as a fantastical phenomenon. I think what he meant was that we can&#39;t predict exactly what AI will end up doing, since research is still in its infancy, so Musk&#39;s claims are unfounded. (EDIT: I spoke with my materials science professor about this when I returned to CMU, and she seems to agree with him.) </p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if I agree with him. I&#39;m a bit skeptical of how his experience with AI systems matches Musk&#39;s. Also, I think it&#39;s important to stay cautious and think about ethical issues that could arise from AI beforehand. I say this because it reminds me of how ethical issues and legislation regarding genetic engineering have not been fully discussed or implemented. This is problematic since the technology is improving rapidly and soon there could be many troubling cases which call for appropriate judgment but will end up being ahead of their time. </p>
<p>Later, I asked Tom what he thought of Elon Musk, since I was wondering if disapproval for Musk was a German thing or an international thing. He also agreed with the German student: Musk&#39;s ideas to use rockets for business is novel and amazing, and would have a market in the future. However, the rest of society isn&#39;t at that point yet, and so many his ideas aren&#39;t so applicable. (Or maybe it&#39;s just a person thing. The people on my Hyperloop team look up to Musk a lot. Plus, there are international teams competing in the Hyperloop competition, so I&#39;m guessing they have the same viewpoint. Interestingly, I&#39;m reminded of a time when during Hyperloop, I suggested using AI to develop our chassis, and someone told me that idea was cliché and maybe overkill.) </p>

<p>There were many other interesting things at RoboCup. For example, in addition to huge drones and an exoskeleton, there were more social robots, often geared toward interacting with kids. One robot in particular was meant to be used in daycares. I recalled Prof. Okazaki&#39;s wish that childcare in Japan offered better options for working mothers. I wonder if robots will end up being a viable solution to this problem? </p>
<p>At the same time that robots were designed to care for children, another team designed a baby robot to bring company to the elderly. Since Japan has an aging population, taking care of seniors will only become more important in the future. </p>
<p>There was also a Young Inventor&#39;s area where kids had invented a wide variety of things from surrogate seeds, enforced with rubber and nutrients for maximum yield, to a Hibachi grill with gear handles installed so you don&#39;t burn your fingers when rotating your kebabs. Not all of the students were Japanese, and it was inspiring (and at the same time a bit sad) to see all this young people&#39;s new ideas (what have I been doing with my life?) </p>

<p>When I came to Japan I had no idea RoboCup was even a thing. It&#39;s probably a testament to the small amount of planning I did prior to coming here. However, I do recall that during our initial ice breaker back in Texas, when we each had to list something we wanted to do in Japan, I&#39;d said I wanted to go to the Robot Restaurant. That was a fad which passed quickly once I learned what the Robot Restaurant actually is. I like to think of my experience at RoboCup as fulfilling that wish instead. It was certainly time well spent. </p>

<p>After RoboCup we took Katelyn and Trevor to meet Tom and the Higashiyama Sky Tower. I was excited to see what Nagoya looks like during the day, and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. After that, Trevor had to go back to Chiba but we took Katelyn to Nana&#39;s Green Tea Café at the Aeon in Aratama&ndash;bashi. All in all it was a good day. </p>
